## Description:

This application demonstrates a simple full stack development CRUD application with front end implemented with Handlebars and Bootstrap 4.  The backend is implemented with Node.js and sequelize.  The database was constructed with Sequelize and implemented to Heroku with JawsDB. 

This is a service desk application that allows users to track issues by submitting, viewing, modifying, or deleting tickets. Users can also view analytics about the submitted tickets powered by Chart.js. Once tickets are submitted, you can update the ticket's notes, change the ticket's completed status to true, or remove the ticket from the database.

## Installation:

#### Step 1 - Make sure you have a code editor, MySQL, Node.js and Node Package Manager installed

The code editor I used was Visual Studio Code. It can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  
Node.js and NPM download can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).  
MySQL workbench can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

#### Step 2 - Clone my repository

In your command terminal, type the following to clone this repository: "git clone https://github.com/TomOverland/Ticket-Tracker.git"

#### Step 3 - Create a config.js file

Using the config.js.example file, create a config.js file with your local MySQL login information.

#### Step 4 - Move to the correct directory

Type the following in your command line: "cd Ticket-Tracker"

#### Step 5 - Install NPM dependencies

By typing "npm install -i" you will download all of the dependencies required for this application.

#### Step 6 - Create the Ticket Tracker Database

Go into your MySQL Workbench, and type the following, "CREATE DATABASE IF DOESNT EXIST ticket_tracker_db", then run execute.

#### Step 7 - Start the application on your local server

Type the following in your command line: "node server.js" and then go to the url "localhost:3000" in your internet browser.  When the server is run locally, Sequelize will create the User and Ticket tables in the database you've just created.

## Project Management
This project was completed during the Fall 2020 Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  Our cohort used a Trello Board to track the progress of our project. We completed mockups, built HTML pages based on those mockups, and translated those HTML pages to Handlebars once complete.  We then presented this project to our Bootcamp. Below you will be able to see our project mockups and a screenshot of our Trello Board.
